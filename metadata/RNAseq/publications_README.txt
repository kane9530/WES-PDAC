# RNAseq analysis request (from Claire)

So the intention for the RNA-seq analysis was 1. as a confirmation that our cohort is representative of the PDAC molecular landscape and 2. some of these classifications have described drug sensitivity associated with certain subtypes, so wanted to see if that was true in our dataset as well. 3. One of the limitations of the classifications is that because they were performed as bulk RNA-seq on tissue, there is some discussion on whether some of the subtypes exist because of immune cell and normal tissue contamination of the tumour samples, and hence are not ‘true’ tumour subtypes. So also was curious as to how our pure tumour organoids would be classified by these measures 

Tiriac 2018 did a similar analysis of what I’d like to do, using the Moffit et al. classification as a comparison. There is a newer classification by Bailey et al. 2016 which has an immunogenic subtype that is defined primarily by the transcriptome of immune infiltrate in the TME (as this was derived from tissue samples) – I don’t expect this subtype to be represented strongly in our organoid cohort as we do not have immune cells, but it gives more granularity to the previously defined Classical subtype (i.e. Moffit Classical subtype = Bailey Pancreatic Progenitor/Immunogenic/ADEX subtype) 

Would it be possible to do the classification using the Moffit and Bailey classification? The TCGA dataset also describes a Basal vs Classical subtype that overlaps with Moffit, but I think Moffit actually excludes normal pancreas and stroma transcripts from its analysis. Lastly, also whether it would be possible to compare with the subtypes derived by Tiriac et al.
